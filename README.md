# AccessDynamicsSampleContext

## A sample Android application that provides a web context handled by Access Dynamics

Set environment variable ANDROID_HOME to the location of your Android SDK, for example (Windows):

`set ANDROID_HOME=%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`

The application has a usual (blank) activity screen, but it doesn't needed to be active for the web context to be served.

After installing the application on your Android device, start Access Dynamics and navigate
in your favourite web browser to the URL listed on the Access Dynamics screen.
